Building an API for credit card approval predictor
It is no disputable fact that in order for banks to survive in a digital environment, the new trend of the financial system is only one: to leverage on machine learning algorithms to automate predictions of its services. However, itâ€™s not enough to just build an algorithm that is able to accurately predict credit card approvals  for instance. There is a need for banks to have a platform that enables them to synchronize , link and connect their database to any application development to make the credit card application approval process more agile and less stressful. That is to say, the credit card API will serve as kind of bridge that will guarantee the traffic of clients data and any application built to check client eligibility for credit card applications.First off, we will build and train a logistic regression machine Learning module on our demonstration data set. After which, we will proceed to use the python framework called Flask to build our API.
